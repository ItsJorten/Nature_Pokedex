# Assets Folder

This folder contains images and other static assets for the Nature Archive app.

## Required Images

You need to add the following images for the app to work properly:

### App Icons (Required)
- `icon.png` - 1024x1024px, app icon
- `adaptive-icon.png` - 1024x1024px, Android adaptive icon foreground
- `splash.png` - 1284x2778px, splash screen image
- `favicon.png` - 48x48px, web favicon

### Recommended Design
- Use the forest green color (#2E7D32) as primary
- Include a leaf or nature-related symbol
- Keep designs simple and recognizable

### Creating Placeholder Icons

For development, you can use these tools:
- [Expo Icon Builder](https://buildicon.netlify.app/)
- [App Icon Generator](https://appicon.co/)
- Or simply create solid green squares as placeholders

### Example icon.png (placeholder)

Create a 1024x1024 PNG with:
- Background: #2E7D32 (forest green)
- Simple leaf icon in white center

For now, the app will show default Expo icons until you add custom ones.
